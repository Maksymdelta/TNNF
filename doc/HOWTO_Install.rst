### Python installation

We use Python **2.7.4+**  
It is true that some (or all) of libraries may work with Python3, but we didn't test this case.

* Linux:  
   Python included in most recent distributive and you can easily run it and check its version.   

   In console:
   ```bash
   user$ python -V
   ```
   If you don't have Python, you can easily installed it on most distributive executing:
  * For Ubuntu/Debian:
   ```bash
user$ sudo apt-get install python
   ```
  * For Red Hat/CentOS:
   ```bash
user$ sudo yum install python
   ```
  * or equivalent for your UNIX based OS.

* Windows:  
   Choose and download correct version for your system from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/).  
   Then run and proceed with installation.

   To check python's version run:
   ```cmd
C:\Users\user> python -V
   ```
